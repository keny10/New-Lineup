V1.0

This theme is based on the defaut theme with a complete new line-up, everything can be translate in other language just by
adding a new json file in localizations directory i have include a french (Canadian) version already

****
I use Real Name, Name field and Race Number in the database 

Use Real name as Firstname and Name as LastName

So Real name = Max  **use a space at the end 
and Name = Verstapen 

Options: 
Render Reserve drivers : if you want to render your reserve driver just toggle this option !

Thanks to 

Sirotkin for making this !

Kaac for support !
